Lottery Contract - Ethereum Smart Contract

This repository contains the source code for a simple lottery smart contract developed in Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain platform. The contract allows participants to enter a lottery by sending 1 ether, with the winner being randomly selected after a certain period of time.

Usage:
1. Setup Environment:
   Ensure you have a development environment set up with an Ethereum client like Ganache or a testnet like Ropsten.
   
2. Deploy Contract:
    Deploy the Lottery.sol contract to your chosen Ethereum network using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
   
3. Interact with the Contract:
    Participants can enter the lottery by sending 1 ether to the contract address. The manager can check the contract balance and other administrative functions.
   
4. Winner Selection:
   After a certain period of time, the manager can execute a function to select a winner randomly from the list of participants.
